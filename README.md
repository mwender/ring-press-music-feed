## What is Ring-Press Music?

Ring-Press was started by [Andrew Duncan](https://www.ring-press.com/about) in 2006 as a place to sell downloadable handbell music while supporting composers and arrangers. Since that time we have grown into a full-featured music store for all kinds of music - orchestra, chamber, piano, vocal, and handbells. From day one, we have paid composers 80-percent royalties (minus transaction fees) of their music sales while offering music at a lower price than other publishing houses. And, we don't take the composer's copyright away from them. Mission accomplished.

## Who is Andrew Duncan?

Andrew Duncan, Editor and Founder of Ring-Press Music, received his Masters degrees in Choral Conducting and Piano Performance from the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music. He is an active arranger and composer and has orchestrated many anthems and carols for orchestra, choir, and handbells, and his music is published by AGEHR/Lorenz, Alfred, CadenzaOne, Discover Worship, GIA Music, and Ring-Press Music.
