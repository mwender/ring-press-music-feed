<h2 id="what-is-ring-press-music-">What is Ring-Press Music?</h2>
<p>Ring-Press was started by <a href="https://www.ring-press.com/about">Andrew Duncan</a> in 2006 as a place to sell downloadable handbell music while supporting composers and arrangers. Since that time we have grown into a full-featured music store for all kinds of music - orchestra, chamber, piano, vocal, and handbells. From day one, we have paid composers 80-percent royalties (minus transaction fees) of their music sales while offering music at a lower price than other publishing houses. And, we don&#39;t take the composer&#39;s copyright away from them. Mission accomplished.</p>
